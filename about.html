    <h1>About Me</h1> 
    <br>

    <p>I was born in South America, in Quito, capital of Ecuador. My native language is Spanish, and most of my professional life I dedicated it to the Software Engineering field.  I obtained my bachelor’s degree on Computers Science at one of the best local schools at the time in Ecuador, and I started working on the IT field before I got graduated.<br>  
    I worked in Ecuador in seven different companies/industries performing different roles: from help desk to manager of IT as well as a programmer, systems analyst, IT instructor, hardware installer, and software engineering among others. <br> <br>   
    I moved to America/California where I had to start from zero. So, I acquired two Associate Degrees, one in Computer Science, and one in Cyber Security. I also became certified in various programming languages and I finally got a Masters on Computers Science. I also have a couple of certifications on the health field along with a certification on photography.<br> <br>
    So, this site is just to show some pictures that I personally like and I just wanted to share with anyone who feels like it.<br>
    Hopefully you’ll enjoy them, but it’s ok if you don’t (lol).<br> <br>
    Peace out.
